Chuck N' Go
Description
This was our Front End Project. We want to combine the comedy from Chuck Norris jokes with a travel app that also included amenities. When you first come to the website you will see a joke at the top. This is coming form a Chuck Norris API. Now you can go to the map and put in a starting and ending destination. You can also select the method of travel. Now on top you can slect the amendities that you want to see on your route.
