# Chuck N' Go
## Description
This was our Front End Project.  We want to combine the comedy from Chuck Norris jokes with a travel app that also included amenities.  When you first come to the website you will see a joke at the top.  This is coming form a Chuck Norris API.  Now you can go to the map and put in a starting and ending destination.  You can also select the method of travel.  Now on top you can slect the amendities that you want to see on your route.
